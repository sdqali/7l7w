This will print a stacktrace, the type of the exception
being raised and the message that you provided. Depending
on your users, a stacktrace might be too scary,
and the actual message might get lost in the noise.
On the other hand, if you die because of
an actual error, a stacktrace will give you additional information for debugging.
