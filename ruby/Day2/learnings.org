** Hash sorting is funny. There are other ways to do stuff.
** Ruby does not have named params. I never noticed because I used hashes.
** A symbol always have the same object id and symbols are not garbage collected.
** Enumerbale#inject and Enumerbale#reduce are the same. And you there is no need to pass an initial value.
** File.owned? - Pretty useful
